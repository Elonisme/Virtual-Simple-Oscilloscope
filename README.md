# Virtual Oscilloscope

This repository contains a simple virtual oscilloscope implemented using PyQt6 and Arduino Nano. The oscilloscope can display voltage waveforms in real-time within the range of 5V. The project is licensed under the GPLv3 license.

[中文版 README](README.zh.md)

## Features

- Real-time voltage waveform display: By connecting the Arduino Nano to a computer, the voltage waveform can be transmitted in real-time and displayed in the graphical interface.
- User-friendly interface: Developed using PyQt6, the oscilloscope provides a simple and intuitive user interface.
- Support for voltage range up to 5V: This virtual oscilloscope is designed for voltage measurements within the range of 5V.

## How to Use

Here are the basic steps to use the virtual oscilloscope:

1. Make sure you have connected the Arduino Nano board to your computer and have properly set up the serial port permissions.

2. **Using Python Code:**

   - Install Python 3.11 on your computer and install the PyQt6 library.
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:

     ```
     git clone git@github.com:Elonisme/Virtual-Simple-Oscilloscope.git
     ```

   - Navigate to the project directory:

     ```
     cd Virtual-Simple-Oscilloscope
     ```

   - Run the main program:

     ```
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Using the Released Executable:**

   - Download the latest executable file for your computer from [Releases](https://github.com/Elonisme/Virtual-Simple-Oscilloscope/releases).
   - Extract the downloaded file.
   - Double-click the executable file to run it.

4. In the graphical interface, you will see the real-time voltage waveform display.
